# update-dependencies-gh-action

GitHub action to automatically open Pull Request to update your **yarn 3** dependencies.

It's a lot like dependabot, but currently dependabot does not support yarn 3, which
is a bummer to me.

## TO DO

The script work, in a very specific way, when run from the CLI. Now I would like to turn it 
into a GH Action, as well as adding support for configuration.
